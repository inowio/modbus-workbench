## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20
### Added
- GitHub Actions release workflow that builds Windows, Linux, and macOS
  installers on every `v*` tag and publishes them as a draft release with
  signed update artifacts.

  release is available, plus a manual "Check for updates" button and a
  "Latest release on GitHub" download link on the About page.
- `npm run release -- X.Y.Z` bump script that syncs the version across
  `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and
  `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, and reshapes `CHANGELOG.md` into a dated section.

  CI secrets, the release loop, pre-releases, and failure recovery.
